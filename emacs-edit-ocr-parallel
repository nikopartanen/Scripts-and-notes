M-x toggle-truncate-lines
M-x scroll-all-mode
M-x global-hl-line-mode
M-x highlight-regexp RET <REGEXP>

It is easy to get regex highlighting disabled with:

M-x unhighlight-regexp or M-s h u

Whenever things go off sync it is good to use:

M-x scroll-up-line
M-x scroll-down-line

Or another option is to select line you want to have the first and do in both buffers:

M 0 Ctrl-L

Or:

M 4 M-x scroll-up-line

And so on.

One good way to set it to scroll one line at time is:

M-: (set-variable â€˜scroll-step 1)

A convenient way to insert tabs is:

C-q <tab>
