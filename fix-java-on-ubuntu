This is not the most sophisticated thing on this planet, but for some reason I couldn't get ELAN work on Ubuntu, but the whole installation just came crashing down with some Java related errors.
So what I ended up doing was something like this:

    sudo apt-get install default-jdk
    sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/java-" 1

After which `which java` returned something normal.
