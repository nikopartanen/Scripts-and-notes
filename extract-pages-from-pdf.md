This is about extracting wanted pages from a PDF file.

    sudo port install pdftk
    https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/

It should run like this:

    pdftk article_collection.pdf cat 30-58 output whoever2000a.pdf

But it does not work on my Mac for some reason! More testing needed, since this is quite important in keeping bibliography consistent...
