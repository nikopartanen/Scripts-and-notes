## Create a new folder for the files and move them there. This is very convenient i.e. when one gets a large number of files with no folder structure but right names for each file.

ls | sed 's/.wav//g' | xargs mkdir ;
#!/bin/bash
for file in `ls`
do
        SESSIONNAME=$(echo $file | sed 's/.wav//g')
        MOVFILE="$file"
        MOVDESTINATION="./$SESSIONNAME/$file"

        # moving the file
        /bin/mv $MOVFILE $MOVDESTINATION;
done


## This was a good way to make new folders with numbering
## In some situations model like 001-099 would be better, but it doesn't really matter in this case

for num in {1..100}; do
    mkdir koi19640000redei-$num
done
